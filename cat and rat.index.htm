<h1>Cat and rat</h1>

<p>
    Once upon a time, there was a cat called tommy who had a friend who is rat called crony,
    the two of them were best of friends people know them for thier friendship in the village
    but crony is known as a thief because he live under his uncle tortoise who is called torty
    and torty was known for decietful behaviour and stealing so because crony was living with
    him th at why crony is also a thief so one day his uncle torty was planning to burn his house
    in a fake way for people to have pity on him and start giving him money for their condolence 
    so as he was planning he dosn't know GOD is above human beings and animals so he just felt that 
    should he make a fake plan or should he just make a real plan he brought out the petrol 
    and matches and pour the petrol around the house and throw on it then the house caught
    fire and GOD showed his greatness on him when house started catching fire he then tried
    to run out of the houseand found out that the door was locked he then remember that
    crony was going out to meet his friend tommy the tortoise told him to close the door from outside
    so that no one can disturb when he want to carry out his plan, but he did'nt know that his plan
    will back fire on him so he start to think that when he die who is going to take the money he wanted 
    to take from the people in the village so that is how he got burnt.
    Later on that day, as crony was arriving from his friend's house he saw that his house is burning 
    from afar, so he ran towards the house only to find his brother getting burnt in the fire so he had
    to run back to his friend house to seek for his help to help him put off the fire inorder to rescue 
    his brother, but he find out that his brother was no longer alive, so during all that period cronny was
    weeping profusely and his friend was calming him down so he later stop crying and he was thinking that 
    the house has burnt down an his uncle as died, where am i going to live asking his friend and his friend 
    said that cronny should live with him, crony was happy and he went home together with Tommy his friend.
    Few weeks later cronny did'nt find any work to do and he has become burden on Tommy on because whenever
    Tommy goes for hunting and brought meat home, it is cronny that will finish all the meat and Tommy won't
    be able to eat anything, still cronny won't search for work to do. Later on, Tommy was feed up because 
    what cronny did this time has made Tommy angry, because the the meat and some coins that tommy brought
    that is mean't for someone was stolen by cronny, that is what make Tommy angry that he was chasing
    cronny all around the town till date, that is the reason why cat always chase rat.
